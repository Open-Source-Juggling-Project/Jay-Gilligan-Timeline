# Jay-Gilligan-Timeline

A timeline of Jay Gilligan's Online Videos.

## Tools

- [Timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/): This tool does almost all of the work.
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/): Timeline.js has a simple option, to take the information from a Google Spreadsheet.
- [Data Miner](https://data-miner.io/): In order to easily collect the data from YouTube, Data Miner was used to gran the titles and links.

## Contributing

At this point, it is mostly about putting all of the information into the Google Sheet. There are plenty more videos to move across.

For now, please feel free to open an issue in order to add other videos (and possibly other media), which are mot listed in Jay's YouTube channel.

In the future, it is planned to have a much easier way to contribute the videeos, especially for those without a github account.
